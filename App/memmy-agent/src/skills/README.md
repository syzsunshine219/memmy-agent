# Memmy Skills

This directory contains built-in skills that extend memmy's capabilities.

## Skill Format

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with:
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, metadata)
- Markdown instructions for the agent

When skills reference large local documentation or logs, prefer memmy's built-in
`grep` tool to narrow the search space before loading full files.
Use `grep(output_mode="count")` / `files_with_matches` for broad searches first,
use `head_limit` / `offset` to page through large result sets,
and `grep(glob="*.md")` to filter by file name pattern.

## Attribution

These skills are adapted from [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)'s skill system.
Runtime metadata uses memmy-agent's own `metadata.memmy` namespace.
